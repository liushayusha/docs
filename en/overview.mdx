## Platform Benefits

### Transparent Pricing

Pay-as-you-go, no subscription required. All models have clear per-token prices, more affordable than official vendor prices, while maintaining the same quality and low latency.

* All models have clear per-token prices
* Enterprise users enjoy bulk discounts
* No hidden fees
* Pay only for actual usage

### Multi-Vendor Routing and Enterprise-Grade SLA

Built-in intelligent routing for multiple LLM vendors, ensuring high availability and low latency. When a vendor fails, requests automatically switch to backup vendors with no service interruption.

### 99.9% Uptime SLA

Enterprise-grade reliability with automatic failover. Multi-vendor routing ensures requests are always processed with minimum latency.

### Global CDN Acceleration

Global edge nodes provide the lowest latency. Optimized routing reduces response times and enhances global user experience.

### Rate Limit Management

Automatically handle rate limits across vendors. Intelligent request distribution prevents throttling, ensuring smooth operation.

### Real-time Status

Monitor endpoint health and performance. Track asynchronous tasks for image and video generation and receive notifications via webhook. [View Status →](/en/api-reference/tasks/status)

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does image and video generation work?">
    Image generation is synchronous and can return results immediately. Video generation is asynchronous — after you submit a request, you will receive a task_id, then poll the status endpoint to check progress and obtain the final video URL.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does the SLA include?">
    Our enterprise SLA includes a 99.9% uptime guarantee, global CDN acceleration, multi-vendor routing and automatic failover, and real-time status monitoring. Asynchronous tasks support rate limiting and webhooks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is pricing calculated?">
    APIMart offers transparent pay-per-request billing, applicable for image and video generation. Pay-as-you-go with no subscription required, enterprise users receive bulk discounts, and there are no hidden fees. Charges apply only for successfully generated content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about latency and performance?">
    Low latency is ensured through global CDN acceleration and intelligent multi-vendor routing. Image generation is typically instantaneous, while video generation time depends on the model (40-300 seconds). Real-time status monitoring lets you track asynchronous task progress.
