## Platform Benefits

### Transparent Pricing

Pay-as-you-go, no subscription required. All models have clear per-token prices, more affordable than official providers, while maintaining the same quality and low latency.

* All models have clear per-token prices
* Enterprise users enjoy volume discounts
* No hidden fees
* Pay only for actual usage

### Multi-Provider Routing and Enterprise-Grade SLA

Built-in intelligent routing for multiple LLM providers ensures high availability and low latency. Automatically switches requests to backup providers in case of provider failure, with no service interruption.

### 99.9% Uptime SLA

Enterprise-grade reliability with automatic failover. Multi-provider routing ensures requests are always handled with minimum latency.

### Global CDN Acceleration

Global edge nodes provide minimal latency. Optimized routing reduces response time, enhancing user experience worldwide.

### Rate Limiting Management

Automatically manages rate limits between providers. Intelligent request distribution prevents throttling, ensuring smooth operation.

### Real-time Status

Monitor endpoint health and performance. Track progress of asynchronous tasks for image and video generation, and get notifications via webhook. [View Status →](/en/api-reference/tasks/status)

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do image and video generation work?">
    Image generation is synchronous and can return results immediately. Video generation is asynchronous—you will receive a task_id after submitting the request, and then check progress and obtain the final video's URL by polling the status endpoint.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does the SLA include?">
    Our enterprise SLA includes a 99.9% uptime guarantee, global CDN acceleration, multi-vendor routing and automatic failover, as well as real-time status monitoring. Asynchronous tasks support rate limit management and webhooks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is pricing calculated?">
    APIMart offers transparent pay-per-request billing for both image and video generation. Pay-as-you-go with no subscription required, enterprise users enjoy bulk discounts, with no hidden fees. Charges apply only to successfully generated content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about latency and performance?">
    Low latency is ensured through global CDN acceleration and intelligent multi-vendor routing. Image generation is typically instantaneous, while video generation times depend on the model (40-300 seconds). Real-time status monitoring allows you to track asynchronous task progress.
