## Platform Benefits

### Transparent Pricing

Pay-as-you-go, no subscription required. All models have clear per-token pricing, more affordable than official provider prices, while maintaining the same quality and low latency.

* All models have clear per-token pricing
* Enterprise users enjoy bulk discounts
* No hidden fees
* Pay only for actual usage

### Multi-Provider Routing and Enterprise-Grade SLA

Built-in intelligent routing across multiple LLM providers ensures high availability and low latency. Automatically switches requests to backup providers during a provider failure with no service interruption.

### 99.9% Uptime SLA

Enterprise-grade reliability with automatic failover. Multi-provider routing ensures requests are always processed with minimal latency.

### Global CDN Acceleration

Global edge nodes provide the lowest latency. Optimized routing reduces response times and enhances the experience for global users.

### Rate Limit Management

Automatically handles rate limits among providers. Intelligent request allocation prevents throttling to ensure smooth operation.

### Real-time Status

Monitors endpoint health and performance. Tracks the progress of asynchronous image and video generation tasks and notifies via webhook. [View Status →](/en/api-reference/tasks/status)

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do image and video generation work?">
    Image generation is synchronous and returns results immediately. Video generation is asynchronous — after you submit a request, you receive a task_id, then poll the status endpoint to check progress and get the final video URL.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does the SLA include?">
    Our enterprise SLA includes a 99.9% uptime guarantee, global CDN acceleration, multi-vendor routing with automatic failover, and real-time status monitoring. Asynchronous tasks support rate limit management and webhooks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is pricing calculated?">
    APIMart offers transparent pay-per-request billing for image and video generation. Pay as you go, no subscriptions required, with volume discounts for enterprise users and no hidden fees. Charges apply only to successfully generated content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about latency and performance?">
    Low latency is ensured through global CDN acceleration and intelligent multi-vendor routing. Image generation is generally instantaneous, while video generation time depends on the model (40–300 seconds). Real-time status monitoring lets you track asynchronous task progress.
