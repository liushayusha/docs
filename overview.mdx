## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do image and video generation work?">
    Image generation is synchronous and returns results immediately. Video generation is asynchronous—you submit a request, receive a task_id, then poll the status endpoint to check progress and retrieve the final video URL.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's included in the SLA?">
    Our enterprise SLA includes 99.9% uptime guarantee, global CDN acceleration, multi-provider routing with automatic failover, and real-time status monitoring. Rate limit management and webhook support are included for async tasks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does pricing work?">
    APIMart offers transparent per-request pricing for image and video generation. Pay-as-you-go with no subscription, volume discounts for enterprise usage, and no hidden fees. Only pay for successful generations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about latency and performance?">
    Low latency is guaranteed through global CDN acceleration and intelligent multi-provider routing. Image generation is typically instant, while video generation times vary by model (40-300 seconds). Real-time status monitoring lets you track async tasks.
